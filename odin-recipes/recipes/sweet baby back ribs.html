    <h3>Ribs you will love</h3>
    <p>Tender, sweet, and sticky baby back ribs that only take 1 hour from prep to plate. If you like them with a little spice, add a teaspoon of cayenne pepper to the dry rub. I make this in my 8-quart Instant Pot® Duo; a 6-quart pot may require less liquid.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 racks baby back pork ribs</li>
        <li>Quarter cup dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons garlic salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chili powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste (Optional) </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Combine brown sugar, garlic salt, chili powder, black pepper, and cayenne pepper in bowl. Coat the ribs generously with the dry rub.</li> 
      <li>Place the trivet inside the Instant Pot®. Place ribs on the trivet on their sides, with one inside the other. Close and lock the lid and make sure the vent is sealed. Select manual high pressure and set the timer for 30 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.</li>
      <li>Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions for 15 minutes. Release remaining pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid.</li>
      <li>Transfer ribs to a broiling pan and generously coat with barbecue sauce.</li>
      <li>Cook in the broiler until barbeque sauce is bubbly and caramelized, 5 to 7 minutes</li>
    </ol>
